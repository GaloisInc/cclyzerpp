cclyzer++
=========

..
  The following text also appears in the top-level README.rst. Changes here
  should be reflected there, and vice-versa.

cclyzer++ is a precise and scalable global pointer analysis for LLVM code. The
output of cclyzer++ can be used for a variety of program analysis tasks,
including:

* Creation of callgraphs with precise handling of indirect function calls and
  virtual method calls
* Precise inter-procedural control- and data-flow analysis
* Answering may-alias and must-not-alias queries

See the :ref:`design documentation <design>` for further explanation and
examples of the output of cclyzer++.

cclyzer++ is field- and array-sensitive, performs on-the-fly callgraph
construction, and supports many different configurations of
:ref:`context-sensitivity <context-sensitivity>` including *k*-callsite
sensitivity. It has subset-based (Andersen style) and unification-based
(Steensgaard style) analyses. cclyzer++ is written in `Soufflé Datalog`_, and so
is highly parallel. cclyzer++ was derived from `cclyzer`_.

cclyzer++ is not currently actively developed or maintained by Galois, Inc.
